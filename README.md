## Product Roadmap

### Epic 1: Vault
This first module allows farmers to track inventory, project revenue based on prices in the product catalog, and compare projected revenue against actual revenue (by recording point of sale and integrating with Quickbooks).

### Epic 2: Lipstick
E-Commerce website integrates with Farmhacker inventory/revenue. Items are displayed to customers based on average weight and price of what's in the inventory so they get an accurate idea of what they'll be paying. Famrers can enter fulfillment avenues (e.g. farmers markets, CSA pickup, on-farm pickup, etc.) and customers can choose how to receive their items.

### Epic 3+: CrowdCSAX
Customers publish their grocery lists, producers fulfill the items. A producer can be anyone from a home gardener to a local commercial farm; they can view a dashboard that shows all open orders that match items in their inventory, then bid on the items. Customers can then select the winning bids to fulfill their grocery lists. From here there are multiple fulfillment options: 1.) courier service collects items and delivers; 2.) user downloads a shopping itinerary and picks up items, 3.) producers drop orders to hub, where customers pick them up.
