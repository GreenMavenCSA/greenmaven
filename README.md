## Product Roadmap

### Epic 1: Vault
This first module allows farmers to track inventory, project revenue based on prices in the product catalog, and compare projected revenue against actual revenue (by recording point of sale). Vault is the central module that drives the rest of the system - in aggregrate across all the farms using it, Vault would effectively represent the entire catalog of local farm products available for sale in a particular region. Vault would integrate tightly with Quickbook's sales register and inventory in order to spur widespread adoption.

### Epic 2: Lipstick
E-Commerce website integrates with Farmhacker inventory/revenue. Items are displayed to customers based on average weight and price of what's in the inventory so they get an accurate idea of what they'll be paying. Famrers can enter fulfillment avenues (e.g. farmers markets, CSA pickup, on-farm pickup, etc.) and customers can choose how to receive their items. Each producer will have either a website or a Lipstick enpoint so that customers in CSA-X will be able to trace information about the sourcing of their products. Lipstick endpoints will be to be servable to an existing domain name, or be subdomained to CSA-X.

### Epic 3+: CSA-X
Customers publish their grocery lists, producers fulfill the items. A producer can be anyone from a home gardener to a local commercial farm; they can view a dashboard that shows all open orders that match items in their inventory, then bid on the items. Customers can then select the winning bids to fulfill their grocery lists. From here there are multiple fulfillment options: 1.) courier service collects items and delivers; 2.) user downloads a shopping itinerary and picks up items, 3.) producers drop orders to hub, where customers pick them up.
